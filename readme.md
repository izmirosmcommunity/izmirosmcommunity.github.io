### The Challenge
<neighborhood> has been divided into a <size of grid, i.e. 4x4> grid, with each zone in the grid <dimensions, such as 1000 x 1000 m>. To participate in the challenge, simply capture streets and paths in each zone. The contributor with the most images in each zone when it is marked as complete will win the zone. The contributor who wins the most zones wins #CompleteTheMap <city>. If you’d like to take part, head into <neighborhood> and start capturing images. Good luck!

### The Rules

**How do I enter the challenge**

Anyone capturing within the grid will automatically participate in the challenge. You don’t need to sign up anywhere.

**The Grid**

We will be checking coverage every day and assigning a color to each zone that represents the coverage status for that area. Red will represent 50% or less of coverage, orange above 50% and green 100% (complete). Only images captured from day one of the competition (<date>) will be counted. 

**Rankings & Updates**

We’ll be maintaining a live page with the results that you can visit any time <link to live map>. In addition to this, we’ll be sending out email updates participants at the start and end of each week.

**How to win**

The winner of each zone will be the contributor with the most photos in that area when the zone is marked as complete (goes green). The overall winner will thus be the one to collect the most zones by improving coverage in that area. The competition will end when all the zones go green or on <end date>, whichever comes sooner. 

To keep the challenge as fair as possible, we will make sure that photos taken in each zone are useful. When necessary, we’ll manually update the zone to make sure it accurately reflects the state of photo coverage in that area. You’re welcome to send in feedback to tell us which zones need to be adjusted.

**Invite Friends**

If you would like to invite your friends to take part in the challenge, all they have to do is capture within the grid area and they will automatically appear on the leaderboard. If they want to stay updated, make sure they subscribe to our email updates and follow the #CompletetheMap hashtag on Facebook and Twitter.
